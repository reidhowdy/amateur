# amateur


Amateur is an iOS app for people that want to learn new crafting skills without pretention. 
Users are "amateur" crafters that can either share their skills by posting an "offer,"
or ask to learn something by posting an "ask."
Users offer their time and energy without payment in return, but the general hope is that
those that benefit from an ask also offer things from time to time.
When asks/offers are complete, users can also share success stories for the community to see.
Everyone has a skill they can share, and we don't need fancy classes or materials to learn new things.

The app uses the Lottie library for animations and Google Firebase for its database.

To use, you can copy the repo, download it, create a Google Firebase account, and import the following libraries:
FirebaseAuth
FirebaseDatabase
FirebaseStorage
Lottie

In your Firebase database, you will need 4 collections called:
asks
offers
users
successes
